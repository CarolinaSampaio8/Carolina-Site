   **PPO Deployment across EU (Project Null)**
    - The Deployment of the AMZL EU Last Mile package size awarness modelling within the ZERO model. Answering the problem statement of how can we have a LM costing model that is based on geographical coincidence but also package size awarness. 
     - Automation with SQL Extract Jobs and Tableau for visualization.

    **Carriers' Cohabitation and package selection project**
    -With the Cohabitation program and CCs volume agreement the aim is to optimize the volume being moved around between AMZL and CCs; Also motoring the volume movements actuals and forward looking in order to ensure we have the suitable S&OP volume planned in line with the cohabitation expectations.

    **Configuration Audit and promise variations impact on volume**
    - Set of dashboards that are able to automate the promise mechanism on ATROPS and the configuration for Peak, Holidays, and specific events days. Preventing manual ATROPS simulation checks done during Peak.

    **Connectivity Optimization tool**
    - EU-wide project of continuous improvement of connectivity working backwards from losses due to PDD miss generated by breaks in the network and impacting Attainment.     
    - SMART Goals: Improve connectivity tools to improve time spent on preparing the callouts â€” done, time required reduced from 4h to 2h, 50% improvement Connect new network assessment tool to KTG data, further reducing time spent to prepare callouts to 1h while going to the third 'why' (first tool prepared covers first two 'whys'. Further automate callout system and tracking, in order to improve experience by users (NC, NE, NPI) and have more effective call discussion on Thursdays
